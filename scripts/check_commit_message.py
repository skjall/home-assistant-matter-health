"""Refuse a commit message the release notes cannot read.

Versions and the changelog are built from the commit messages on main, and the
changelog is what Home Assistant shows before an update. A message without a
type is invisible to that: a whole release's worth of work once arrived as one
line because the commits it was squashed from said nothing release-please could
use.
